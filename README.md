# Neovim config

This config is inspired by ThePrimegen's "Neovim RC From Scratch". 

I'm still working on to make it tailored to my workflow.

```
git clone https://github.com/kotikkir9/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

```
Note: ripgrep need to be installed on the system, else the grep-keymap won't work.
```
